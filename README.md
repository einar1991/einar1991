## Hi there, I'm Einar 👋

I'm a backend developer and I'm seeking my first job. Don't mind if it's gonna be testing or something else.

### Check out my pet projects

My pet projects may be small in scale, but I've used them to master technologies and best practices from large-scale, professional development.
